          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I'm a software engineering student with a focus on Front End Development. I grew up doing theatre, so the collaborative aspects of software engineering really attracted me!</p>
          <p>In my professional life, I've worked in social media management and childcare, and I look forward to finding ways to apply those skills to code.</p>
          <p>In my spare time, I love playing board games, reading books, and snuggling my two cats.</p>

          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>In school, I always struggled with math and science, so I studied Playwriting as an undergrad. To this day, I love playwriting, but I always had to find other jobs to make ends meet. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit and theatres shut down, I started seriously contemplating my career path. I made a list of all the people I admire most and want my life to look more like, and do you know what they all had in common? They all knew how to code! From there, I decided to take a few courses online to see if I could even understand code--and I fell in love! I loved that writing code was similar to working line-by-line while writing a play. Now I'm learning to code full time, and I can't wait to enter my career in tech!</p>
